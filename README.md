# SentimentAnalysisProject
Sentiment Analysis project for Comp 215

This is my first of two projects for my Comp 215 course.
I'm very interested in machine learning so I chose this topic to give me an excuse to dive deeper
and learn more about how to build datasets and use statistical approaches to predict sentiment
